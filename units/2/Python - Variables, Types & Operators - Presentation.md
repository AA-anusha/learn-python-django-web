> A variable is a symbolic name for (or reference to) information. The variable's name represents what information the variable contains.

#### For Instance
`foo` and `bar` could be variables that are just symbolic names which represents some information in the memory. 

```python
# Variable foo contains "Some Information"
foo = "Some Information"

# And variable bar contains 15.04
bar = 15.64

# Now variable `foo` can be used to get the reference of that "Some Information"
print("It contains", foo)

# And they could be used in expressions too
print("Result = ", 5 * bar + 2)
```
